# Raindolf Syte

Syte is a really simple but powerful packaged personal site that has social integrations like Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble, Instagram, Foursquare, Tumblr, Wordpress, Linkedin, Spotify/Last.fm, SoundCloud, Bitbucket, StackOverflow, Flickr and Steam. You can see my website in action here [Raindolf Owusu](http://raindolf.heroku.com/).
